#+title: My custom QMK keymaps

* Background
This repository is for my custom QMK code for both keymaps (i.e. just the
keyboard layout and features), as well as code for a handwired keyboard (the
matrix and keyboard layout).

I keep this as as separate directory to the forked =qmk_firmware= directory and
use the =setup= script to create symlinks into the relevant directories in
=qmk_firmware= so that I can build the firmware for my boards and layouts. I
shamelessly stole this idea from someone else's QMK configs, but I can't remember
which setup now, I'm afraid. I'm happy to include a link if someone recognises
it.

* mini3x5
This is a keymap for a 34 key [[https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep][Ferris Sweep
v2.1]] which is a super-compact 3x5+2 Kailh Choc keyboard. I've taken inspiration
from a lot of other users' keymaps:

- One-shot mods and single key app switching from [[https://github.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum][callum]]
- [[https://github.com/treeman/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/splitkb/kyria/keymaps/treeman][Layer arrangement]] and 'numword' setup from [[https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout/#base-layer][Jonas Hietala]]
- 'capsword' setup from [[https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/caps-word/index.html][Pascal Getreuer]]

...and probably many others that I've forgotten about.

The layout uses combos on the baselayer to replace keys like enter and escape
that do not fit on a small keyboard, one-shot mods/layers and a combo to
activate a 'numword' layer which automatically de-activates when a non-numerical
character is typed.
